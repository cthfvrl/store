# store

This code decides whether it's possible to fit a set of boxes in the store.

Input data has the following format: 3 lenghts of the store, then lenghts of the boxes (3 for each box). In the example "source.cpp" file data is supposed to be placed in the "input.txt" file. 

Output data has the following format: coordinates of boxes according to one of the possible layouts if boxes do fit into the store or a message indicating they don't. The data is written into the console.
